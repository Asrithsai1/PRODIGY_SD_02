## Features

- *Clear and Reset*: Clears the input field and resets the game state.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (pre-installed with most Python setups)

1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your machine.
2. Clone this repository or download the script file.
3. Navigate to the directory where the script is located.
4. Run the script with the following command:
   bash
   python guessing_game.py
   
5. A Guessing Game window will open, and you can start playing immediately.

## Usage

1. *Input a Guess*: Enter your guess into the provided text field.
2. *Click the "Guess" Button*: Submit your guess and receive feedback.
